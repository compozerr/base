# Deploy a module

Deploying a module is a simple process that can be done with the `compozerr` CLI.

## How to

To deploy a module, use the following command:

```bash
compozerr deploy module <name>
```

This command will build the module and deploy it to the community registry, making it available for others to use. If you already deployed the module, this command will update the existing version.
