# Create a module

A **module** is a self-contained full-stack package that can be shared with the community. It can include both frontend and backend implementations, or just one of them.

## How to

To create a new module, use the following command:

```bash
compozerr new module <name>
```

This command will generate a template module in your `modules` folder, providing you with a starting point for your development.

:::warning Requires login
This command requires you to be [logged in](./login.md) to your compozerr account.
